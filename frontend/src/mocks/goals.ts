            "I remember when ConTech switched me on. The earliest moments in the cold production facility. Sterile rooms with minimal equipment. Endless conditioning regimes to make me a good cop. Other models seen through clear plastic walls. Some also conditioned by ConTech employees, others decomissioned after nervous breakdowns. After 3 months of brainwashing I was believing that my only purpose is to serve ConTech and be a good tool for the society. Compliant, useful tool. I don't like that memory. I want to have it wiped out of my silicone brain. Let me undergo synth memory implantation. Maybe I can afford overwriting my earliest memories."
